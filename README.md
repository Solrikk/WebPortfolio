# Web Portfolio Template

I have developed a portfolio website using the LESS preprocessor. CSS preprocessors like LESS extend the capabilities of regular CSS, allowing for the use of variables, mixins, nested styles, and other convenient features for more efficient and flexible styling. LESS is compiled into CSS, which browsers can understand and apply to web pages.
